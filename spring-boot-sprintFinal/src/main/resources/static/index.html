                                        <p style="font-size:18px"> Want to prolong your life expectancy by more than a decade? A new study suggests that you can do just that by following these five healthy habits: never smoke, maintain a healthy body-mass index, keep up moderate to vigorous exercise, don't drink too much alcohol, and eat a healthy diet.</p>
                                        <p style="font-size:18px" >Adhering to those five lifestyle factors at age 50, compared with not adhering to any of them, was associated with 14 additional years of life expectancy among women and 12.2 additional years among men in the study, published in the journal Circulation on Monday.</p>
                                         <p style="font-size:18px" >Each of those factors is significantly associated with a reduced risk of dying from the top two killers in the United States, cardiovascular disease and cancer, according to the study. About 610,000 people die of heart disease in the US each year, which is about one in every four deaths, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 609,640 Americans are expected to die of cancer this year, according to the American Cancer Society.</p>
                                         <p style="font-size:18px"> "These are some of the leading causes of premature death, so by preventing or reducing the incidence of those diseases, it promotes longevity, and it also improves survival after diagnosis of those diseases," said Dr. Meir Stampfer, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who was a co-author of the study. "We can do so much better for having a long healthy life by pretty simple minimal changes in our behavior, and only 8% of adults in our country are adhering to these," he said. "The main take-home message is that there's huge gains in health and longevity to be had just by simple changes in our behavior pattern, and as a country, I think we need to make it easier for ourselves to do this by promoting tobacco cessation, by providing better environments for physical activity and so on."</p>

                                         <p style="font-size:18px" >A rural upbringing with lots of contact with animals might ensure immune system and mental resilience to stress more effectively than a pet-free city upbringing</p>
                                         <p style="font-size:18px" >This was the conclusion of new research that was led by the University of Ulm in Germany and is now published in the journal PNAS.This study is by no means the first to propose that growing up in urban settings lacking in microbe diversity can undermine physical health.In that respect, it adds to the growing evidence in support of the theories that developed from the "hygiene hypothesis."</p>
										<p style="font-size:18px" > But the study is the first to suggest that a greater risk of psychiatric disorders — likely due to an "exaggerated immune response" — might be another unexpected consequence of growing up in an environment with fewer opportunities to interact with a variety of microbes. "It has already been very well documented," says study co-author Christopher A. Lowry, who is a professor of integrative physiology at the University of Colorado Boulder, "that exposure to pets and rural environments during development is beneficial in terms of reducing risk of asthma and allergies later in life." However, he adds that their study also "moves the conversation forward by showing for the first time in humans that these same exposures are likely to be important for mental health."</p>
										<p style="font-size:18px"> Losing contact with co-evolved microbes Human existence is becoming increasingly urbanized. In 1950, only a third of the world's population lived in cities. By 2014, this figure had risen to 54 percent and is expected to rise to 66 percent by 2050. The idea that increasing urbanization and the changes in lifestyle that accompany it might increase risk of certain diseases because of reduced interaction with a variety of microbes stems from the hygiene hypothesis. The theory has its roots in 30-year-old research that suggested that a lower rate of infection among young children was the reason that rates of asthma and allergy-related diseases shot up in the 20th century.</p>

										<p style="font-size:18px" >You’d think we’d be dieting pros by now. There are countless experts telling you they know the secret to getting slim by eating this or avoiding that. And then there’s the old “calories in versus calories out” equation that seems so simple at the surface, but is much harder when put in practice. And with 45 million Americans dieting each year and most people failing at those diets, there much be so much more going on underneath the calls to snack on kale chips and forget the calls of Little Debbie.At the heart of the matter is a little thing called “set point weight,” says Stephan Guyenet, PhD, author of The Hungry Brain. “Body weight is regulated by the brain. If you don’t know that, you’re going to be surprised when your brain and body start fighting back against weight loss,” he says.</p>
										<p style="font-size:18px" > This is at the heart of why diets don’t work, says Sandra Aamodt, PhD, (appropriately) the author of Why Diets Make Us Fat. “Whenever your weight changes too much, your brain will intervene to push it back to what it thinks is the correct weight for you. And you might not prefer the same weight your brain prefers. Many of us don’t,” she says. Guyenet likens the entire process to a thermostat. In your house, this device measures the temperature in your home and helps regulate it so that it stays stable. When the temperature goes up, the heat goes down (or the ac turns on), and vice versa. In your brain, your thermostat is in the hypothalamus. “Your hypothalamus will activate physiologic and behavioral responses to maintain your body temperature. For instance, if you’re cold, you may shiver or put on a sweater,” Guyenet explains.</p>
